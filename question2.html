1.The JavaScript method toString() converts an array to a string of (comma separated) array values.
Example
var fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = fruits.toString();
Result
Banana,Orange,Apple,Mango

2.The join() method also joins all array elements into a string.
It behaves just like toString(), but in addition you can specify the separator:
Example
var fruits = ["Banana", "Orange","Apple", "Mango"];
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = fruits.join(" * ");
Result
Banana * Orange * Apple * Mango

3.Popping and Pushing
When you work with arrays, it is easy to remove elements and add new elements.
This is what popping and pushing is:
Popping items out of an array, or pushing items into an array.
Popping
The pop() method removes the last element from an array:
Example
var fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
fruits.pop(); 

4.
Pushing
The push() method adds a new element to an array (at the end):
Example
var fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
fruits.push("Kiwi"); 

5.Shifting Elements
Shifting is equivalent to popping, working on the first element instead of the last.
The shift() method removes the first array element and "shifts" all other elements to a lower index.
Example
var fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
fruits.shift(); 

6.The unshift() method adds a new element to an array (at the beginning), and "unshifts" older elements:
Example
var fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
fruits.unshift("Lemon");    // Adds a new element "Lemon" to fruits
The shift() method returns the string that was "shifted out".
The unshift() method returns the new array length.

7.Changing Elements
Array elements are accessed using their index number:
Example
var fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
fruits[0] = "Kiwi"; 

8.Deleting Elements
Since JavaScript arrays are objects, elements can be deleted by using the JavaScript operator delete:
Example
var fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
delete fruits[0]; 

9.Splicing an Array
The splice() method can be used to add new items to an array:
Example
var fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
fruits.splice(2, 0, "Lemon", "Kiwi");

10.Using splice() to Remove Elements
With clever parameter setting, you can use splice() to remove elements without leaving "holes" in the array:
Example
var fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
fruits.splice(0, 1); 

11.Sorting an Array
The sort() method sorts an array alphabetically:
Example
var fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
fruits.sort();

12.The reverse() method reverses the elements in an array.
You can use it to sort an array in descending order:
Example
var fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
fruits.sort();           
fruits.reverse(); 

13.Numeric Sort
By default, the sort() function sorts values as strings.
This works well for strings ("Apple" comes before "Banana").
However, if numbers are sorted as strings, "25" is bigger than "100", because "2" is bigger than "1".
Because of this, the sort() method will produce incorrect result when sorting numbers.
You can fix this by providing a compare function:
Example
var points = [40, 100, 1, 5, 25, 10];
points.sort(function(a, b){return a-b});

14.Joining Arrays
The concat() method creates a new array by concatenating two arrays:
Example
var myGirls = ["Cecilie", "Lone"];
var myBoys = ["Emil", "Tobias","Linus"];
var myChildren = myGirls.concat(myBoys);

15.The valueOf() Method
The valueOf() method is the default behavior for an array. It converts an array to a primitive value.
JavaScript will automatically convert an array to a string when a primitive value is expected.
Because of this, all these examples will produce the same result:
Example
var fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = fruits;
